The Wind and the Sun
The North Wind was rushing along and blowing the clouds as he passed.
"Who is so strong as I ?" he cried.
"I am even stronger than the sun."
"Can you show that you are stronger ?" asked the Sun.
"A traveler is coming over the hill," said the Wind.
"Let us see which of us can first make him take off his long cloak.
The one who succeeds will prove himself the stronger."
The North Wind began first.
He blew a gale, tore up trees, and raised clouds of dust.
But the traveler only wrapped his cloak more closely about him, and kept on his way.
Then the Sun began to shine.
He drove away the clouds and warmed air.
Higher and higher he climbed in the blue sky, shining in all his glory.
"What a fine day we are having after the blow !" said the traveler, as he threw off his cloak.
